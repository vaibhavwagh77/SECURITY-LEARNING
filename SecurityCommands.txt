squid
-------\
Squid is caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. Which is used to speed up a web server by caching repeated requests, caching web, DNS and filtering traffic.


# yum install squid -y
# apt install squid -y


# systemctl restart squid
# systemctl enable squid

To check:
``````````
# squid -k check | echo $?


Port : 3128

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=squid --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload


RULE:
`````
http_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to access the HTTP port. This is the primary access control list.

http_reply_access: Allows HTTP clients (browsers) to receive the reply to their request. This further restricts permissions given by http_access.










# squid -v

Squid web cach dir: /var/spool/squid

# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf

Test the syntax of squid.conf:
# squid -k parse

# ls /var/log/squid
# ls /var/spool/squid

# systemctl restart squid
OR
# systemctl reload squid
OR
We can reload squid configuration file without restarting service:

# squid -k reconfigure

[1(a)] : The value of the header X-Cache shows that the requested document was not in the Squid cache (MISS) of the computer moon. 

[1(b)] : The example above contains two X-Cache lines. The second one X-Cache-Lookup is produced by the internal caching software of the originating Web server. 

[2] : The value of the header Via shows the HTTP version, the name of the computer, and the version of Squid in use.  


X-Forwarded-For Header:
`````````````````````````
=> If set to "on", squid will append your client's IP address in HTTP req it forwards like:

	X-Forwarded-For: 192.1.1.1

=> If set to "off", it will appear as

	X-Forwarded-For: unknown

=> If set to "transparent", Squid will not alter the "X-Forwarded-For" header in any way.

=> If set to "delete", Squid will delete the extire "X-Forwarded-For" header.

So modify the entry:

forwarded_for delete

And add these after "forwarded_for delete" in the squid.conf file:

request_header_access Allow allow all
request_header_access Authorization allow all
request_header_access WWW-Authenticate allow all
request_header_access Proxy-Authorization allow all
request_header_access Proxy-Authenticate allow all

To change squid proxy hostname:
```````````````````````````````
# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf

visible_hostname anything

:wq



-------\
+++++ check logs 

# tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
-------\


______________________________________________________________________
Enable cache dir :
```````````````````
# how much disk cache do you want. It is 6400 MB in the following example, change it as per
# your needs. Make sure you have that much disk space free.

cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 6400 16 256

- Squid creates 16 level-1 sub-directories in the /var/spool/squid/ directory.
- Squid creates 256 sub-directories in each level-1 directory.

# how much memory cache do you want? depends on how much memory you have on the machine
cache_mem 200 MB

# MAX OBJ SIZE
maximum_object_size 500 MB
maximum_object_size_in_memory 4 MB

# Say "off" if you want the query string to appear in the squid logs.
strip_query_terms off



You can put any number of refresh_pattern lines in the configuration file:

SYNATX: refresh_pattern [-i] regexp min percent max [options]

-i 	: case-insensitive
min 	: the time (in minutes) an object without an explicit expiry time should be considered fresh.
max	: upper limit on how long objects without an explicit expiry time will be considered fresh.

eg: 

refresh_pattern -i \.jpg 30 20% 4320

refresh_pattern -i \.(css|js|png) 30 20% 4320;

#Facebook Pages
refresh_pattern -i \.facebook.com.*\.(jpg|png|gif) 80 20% 4320;  



how do I configure Squid not to cache a specific server? 
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
acl someserver dstdomain .someserver.com
cache deny someserver
__________________________________________________________________


Anonymous browsing
```````````````````




We will block domains such as facebook.com and youtube.com

# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf 
add lines:
``````````
acl blocksite1 dstdomain .facebook.com .youtube.com
http_access deny blocksite1





+++++ To restrict by a part of the URI, do:

acl banned_reddit url_regex Ë†http://.*reddit.com/.*$
http_access deny banned_reddit





+++++ If you want to allow/block specific website then make the entry of blockedsites 

# cat > /etc/squid/blockedsites.squid
.tesla.com
.gmail.com
.cdac.in

#vim /etc/squid/squid.conf 

acl blocksites dstdomain "/etc/squid/blockedsites.squid"
http_access deny blocksites

OR

acl blocksites url_regex "/etc/squid/blockedsites.squid"
http_access deny blocksites




#systemctl restart squid.service
-------\


+++++ Block ports
``````````````````` 
# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf 

acl block_port port 80
http_access deny block_port

acl Safe_ports port 80 21 443 563 70 210 1025-65535
http_access deny !Safe_ports













+++++ Block specific words

# vim /etc/squid/ban_keywords.txt
gambling
spyware
bad
:wq

# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
acl bad_keywords url_regex "/etc/squid/ban_keywords.txt"
http_access deny bad_keywords



------/

++++++ You can also block files
# vim /etc/squid/blockfiles.squid
\.torrent.*$
\.mp3.*$
\.m3u8.*$
\.mp4.*$

# vim /etc/squid/squid.conf
acl blockfiles urlpath_regex "/etc/squid/blockfiles.squid"
http_access deny blockfiles


-------\



++++++ Set working hours
#vim /etc/squid/squid.conf


acl working_hours time 10:00-17:00
http_access deny working_hours
